# WHOS THAT POKEMON???

This is the very first React Native App I have made! It is pretty rudimentary, and does not have a backend. I built this just to solidify my knowledge of React Native.

#HOW IT WORKS

The program generates a random number, and then makes an API call to a pokemon server, and retrieves that pokemon's information.

It then renders that pokemon's image to the user, and allows the user to guess which pokemon it is.

If they get it right, then their current streak count increases! If they get it wrong, then the current streak goes to 0. 

Feel free to try it out :]. You'll be surprised as to how hard it can be haha.
